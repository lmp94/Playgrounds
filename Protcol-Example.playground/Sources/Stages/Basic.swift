                        ** Basic Setup **
 
  Create two protocols:
   (1) Represents a type of object / sprite / etc w/ two properties.
       Requiremnets:
        - One property that is an idenfitier (name, species, etc)
        - One property that is action based
       i.e. Monkey w/ two properies: species(String), hasABannana(Bool)
   (2) Qunification of an action that is relevant to Protcol 1
 
 ** Note: we will be extending these protocols so try to make it something in OOP you
 could see subclasses of. * *
 
 We will be deomstrating a crutical techinque that permits encapsulating of a functional concept w/out neededing a base classe
 
 ** Note: cmd-shift-return to compile
